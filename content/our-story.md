<h2>Adam</h2>

<p>Adam grew up in Colorado, lived in California, went to Dartmouth College, and
worked at NYU before making his way to Madison, Wisconsin to work on a PhD in
cognitive neuroscience. In his spare time, you’re sure to find Adam sailing,
windsurfing, snow kiting, or biking (thanks to Josie).</p>

traveling in South America and working, she’s back in school studying public

<h2>The proposal</h2>
