_Timeline_: From noon until 5 pm, there will be a short ceremony, followed by
lunch, a little dancing, and a lot of yard games. Check back later for more
details.

_Attire_: We're going for a fun and fancy vibe. Think beach formal. According to
the wedding website The Knot, "this suggests an elegant beach wedding -- so
dress to impress, but also dress for the elements (sun, sand, grass, and water).
Anything you'd wear to a nice restaurant on a summer day is appropriate."
